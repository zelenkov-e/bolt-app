## Some comments

On real project I do not use Bootstrap for create components. I prefer to create own React components and reuse them.
If we use Bootstrap components we need to download a lot of additional libraries(jquery, popper) or use React-bootstrap or Reactstrap.
As result we load the system. Also we need to research new syntax that will influence on speed develop.

At current project I use default data( countries code, countries) you can rewrite it use (ex.axios)

Thanks a lot that you give me chance to participate in develop your application
